# Overview
This is not production ready, just a barebones start to what will eventually be a hard mode mod for ttyd

## Credits
* [PistonMiner](https://github.com/PistonMiner) for their work on the TTYD scripting disassembly, the initial code for the rel framework, and the elf2rel, gcipack, and rellink utilities. (GitHub repo for these tools [here](https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools).)
